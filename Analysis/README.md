# single cell brain project

We collected the 95 substantia nigra (SN) samples (45 opioid overdose and 50 control) from Detroid and Miami cohorts. Using the 10x Chromium, we generated 212, 713 high quality single nuclei after quality-control. We performed differential gene expression analysis to identify opioid associated genes.   

The folder `Merge-2022-06-02` include rountine analysis for single cell substantia nigra (SN), including QC, cluster, cell type annotation, differential gene expression analysis and GO enrichment analysis.  

The folder `TWAS` include how to get TWAS in Substantia Nigra tissue associated with substance use traits and disorder (SUD) from [PhenomeXcan database](https://github.com/hakyimlab/phenomexcan) and overlapping SUD genes with opioid DEGs.
